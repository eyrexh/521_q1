```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## Section 1.1

Do some fancy programming, for example, uh, for loop?

```{r}
a <- c(1,2,3)
result <- c()
for (i in a) {
  result <- c(i**10)
}
print(result)
```
It seems that we did this in a wrong way without adding the new value after the old onw it.

## Section 1.2

Let's try to correct it.

```{r}
a <- c(1,2,3)
result <- c()
for (i in a) {
  result <- append(result, i**10)
}
print(result)
```
We did it!
